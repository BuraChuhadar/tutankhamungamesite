# Immigration & Early City Services

It’s been a busy month! In this update, newcomers start arriving in your city and two essential buildings—Well and Water Supply—help you stabilize early growth.

Immigration brings fresh citizens to available homes, as long as they’re connected by roads. Keep your neighborhoods linked and you’ll see steady, believable waves of arrivals.

## How Immigration Works (Player View)

- Periodic arrivals: From time to time, new settlers head toward homes with free space.
- One group per home: To avoid overcrowding, each home receives one group at a time.
- Group size: Typically 1–4 people, and they’ll only fill the space that’s available.
- Must be connected: If a home isn’t connected to your road network, newcomers can’t reach it.
- If a route is blocked: They’ll try again later once your roads make the way clear.

This keeps population growth readable: fix roads, add houses, and you’ll see results quickly.

## Filling Homes and Evolving Neighborhoods

- First residents turn empty plots into simple shelters.
- As services improve (water, later food variety, etc.), homes can evolve to higher levels.
- No instant fills: People arrive via roads—you’ll watch neighborhoods come to life.

## New Buildings: Well and Water Supply

Two water-focused buildings support different stages of your city.

### Well (Early Game)

- Purpose: A small, local water source to kickstart housing viability.
- Where to place: Tuck it near early homes to cover a tight area efficiently.
- Rules of placement: Only on buildable ground and not overlapping roads or other buildings.
- Costs: Shown before you place; pay on build.

### Water Supply (Growing Districts)

- Purpose: A larger water provider with broader coverage for denser neighborhoods.
- Size: Requires a bigger footprint (think a compact facility lot).
- Terrain and fit: The site will adjust as needed when you finalize placement so it sits properly.
- Costs: Also previewed before you build.

---

## Building Placement & Preview

- Visual preview: You’ll see a clear green/red indicator for valid placement.
- Roads and routing: Roads naturally route around placed structures; plan blocks and corridors.
- Clearing: You can remove placed buildings later if you want to rework your layout (with a cost).

## In Short

Connect your roads, keep some housing open, and newcomers will move in steadily. Use Wells to get started and add a Water Supply as your districts densify. With these pieces in place, neighborhoods evolve naturally from simple shelters into thriving blocks.
