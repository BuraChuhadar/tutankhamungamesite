This is the first in a series of monthly development updates where I’ll be sharing progress, visuals, and ongoing work to give you a clearer look at how the game is evolving over time.

## Grass and Terrain Readability

Over the past few weeks, the grass visuals have gone through a major overhaul. The goal wasn’t just “prettier grass”—it was clarity.

The terrain is now easier to read at a glance, with fertile land, desert, and developed areas clearly distinguishable while still feeling cohesive and natural. A lot of time has gone into tuning grass density, color variation, and how different ground types blend into one another. The result is a landscape that adds atmosphere and beauty without becoming visually noisy or creating distracting patterns across the map.

Just as importantly, this pass was built with performance in mind. The improvements aim to enhance readability and mood without pushing the scene into expensive overdraw or unnecessary detail.

## Food Chain Systems Nearing Completion

Alongside the visual improvements, work is wrapping up on the core food chain systems.

Farming, granaries, and bazaars are being finalized so food production, storage, and distribution work together in a clear, reliable, and intuitive way as settlements grow and population demands increase. These systems are a critical foundation for long-term city planning and economic balance—if food logistics aren’t predictable, everything else becomes harder to design and harder to play.

This “food backbone” is about making sure:

- Farms generate dependable output and communicate what they need.
- Granaries provide stable storage and help smooth seasonal or logistical gaps.
- Bazaars distribute food in a way that feels understandable and controllable as districts scale.

## What’s Next: Military Systems

With the food systems nearing completion, the next major focus will shift toward military systems. This will introduce new strategic considerations around defense, threats, and how your settlement prepares for and responds to danger.
